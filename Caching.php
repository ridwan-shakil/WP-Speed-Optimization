// Browser caching :

// stores static files from your WordPress website, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files, locally on their devices.
// By doing so, subsequent visits to your site will retrieve these cached files from the browser's storage,

// Page caching : 
// ---------------------
// stores a copy of the generated HTML page in the server's memory or disk, and then serves that copy to subsequent visitors instead of
// generating the page from scratch each time.

// Object caching :
// ---------------------
// stores frequently accessed database queries and complex data structures in memory, reducing the need to retrieve them from the database repeatedly.
