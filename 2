1) light hous crome extension 
2) wp server stats plugin ( to see all statistics )
3) wp reset plugin ( to take snapshot & rollback )

4) Must mentain a checklist ( what you are doing & what is the impact ) 

===========================
NOTES
===========================
* all the images should load from media library , not from plugin directory or theme dir.
  (open image in a new tab) if the link has 'plugin' or 'theme' keyword , it means they aren't 
  loading from media library , download them > upload them > and set to there place
  [ it's important because if they are not loading from media library , we can not optimize them ]


===========================
Steps
===========================
* permalink flash ( url rewrite, .htaccess is ready )
* regenrate thumbnail plugin ( new theme & plugins may register new image sizing ,
  our old images that are in media library we have to regenrate them ,
  so they get the new sizes ) 
* smush plugin ( whenever uploading a new image it will compress the image,
  lazy loading  & other image optimizations )
------ CHECK THE SCORE & NOTE IT DOWN ------


=========== Webp ( Next gen. image format ) ===========
* download 'webp express' plugin ( it will serve images in webp format on the fly ) ( it will work with lightspeed , appache server but with enginex server we will have to make some configaration )    
* settings > webp express > save setting 
------ CHECK THE SCORE & NOTE IT DOWN ------


========== Cpanal ========
If has scope do the below tasks
* Increas php version ( select php version > select latest version > click 'set as current 
* Increas memory limit ( options > increase memory limit ) ( increase file upload limit )
* Enable necessery extensions ( zip, imagick, gd )
* Cpanel > Optimize website > select Compress all content > click upload setting ( Whenever 
  any risponse go from our server to client browser , it will go in the compressed form ,
  so it will reduce bandwidth usage )
------ CHECK THE SCORE & NOTE IT DOWN ------


========= jQuery =========
* Update jQuery into latest version
* download " jquery manager " plugin > tools > jquery manager > 'select jquery version' > save
  incognito window > test if there is any error showing on 'console' ? if yes . then change the version and check again
------ CHECK THE SCORE & NOTE IT DOWN ------
  
========= Ensure text remains visible during webfont load ========
( This error means: If any external fonts has been added , the text may not show before loading the font ) 
* solution 1 : where the font is linking > at the end there should be added : font-display: swap;  //search google
* solution 2 : download 'Swap Google Fonts Display' plugin & all done  
 ------- CHECK THE SCORE & NOTE IT DOWN ------

--------------------------------------------------------- Browser Cashing --------------------------------------------------------------

========= Wp super cache  & Fast Velocity Minify plugin ( for cashing & minification )( Ref.video No 2.10 )
* wp super cashe install > check recomended settings 
* Fast velocity minify install > 
after doing chages > purge chshe 
------ CHECK THE SCORE 2 times ( 2nd time will load from cash ) & NOTE IT DOWN ------



OR ========== Lightspeed cashe plugin ======== ( Ref.video No 2.12 )
* Install lightspeed Plugin > 

------ CHECK THE SCORE 2 times ( 2nd time will load from cash ) & NOTE IT DOWN ------
