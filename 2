1) light hous crome extension 
2) wp server stats plugin ( to see all statistics )
3) wp reset plugin ( to take snapshot & rollback )

4) Must mentain a checklist ( what you are doing & what is the impact ) 

===========================
NOTES
===========================
* all the images should load from media library , not from plugin directory or theme dir.
  (open image in a new tab) if the link has 'plugin' or 'theme' keyword , it means they aren't 
  loading from media library , download them > upload them > and set to there place
  [ it's important because if they are not loading from media library , we can not optimize them ]

===========================
Steps
===========================
---------- After every step take a note of speed ----------

* permalink flash ( url rewrite, .htaccess is ready )
* regenrate thumbnail plugin ( new theme & plugins may register new image sizing ,
  our old images that are in media library we have to regenrate them ,
  so they get the new sizes ) 
* smush plugin ( whenever uploading a new image it will compress the image,
  lazy loading  & other image optimizations )
*
